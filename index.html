    <h1>MY HOBBYS</h1>
    <h1>playing video games</h1>
    <p>A video game[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.</p>
    <h1> listning to music </h1>
    <p>K-pop is a musical genre that utilizes many different sounds and influences. The music features catchy beats, hooks, rapping, and instrumentals for dance breaks. The lyrics are often in Korean, though groups like Blackpink and BTS have a slew of songs that feature English and Korean lyrics.</p>
    <h1>playing p.t games </h1>
    <p>Physical education, also known as Phys Ed., PE, or gym is a subject taught in schools. It is taught during primary and secondary education and encourages psychomotor learning in a play or movement exploration setting to promote health and physical fitness. ... Physical Education programs vary all over the world.</p>
    <h1>coding</h1>
        <p>Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.</p>
